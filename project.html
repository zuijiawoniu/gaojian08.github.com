<p>The birth and death of companies are direct reflections of local economy development and industry structure. Based on the data of listed companies in China, we calculate the proximity of industries to construct the industry space, which is a network representation of the industry structure. We find that the industry space appears to have a core-periphery structure with two density cores, like a dumbbell. The labor/capital-intensive industries and technology-intensive industries respectively occupy one core. Moreover, the more-sophisticated industries are located in densely connected cores whereas less sophisticated industries occupy a less-connected peripheries.</p>
<p>Further, we find that the industry space evolves slowly over time. Specifically, neighbour provinces who take the labor/capital-intensive industries as the pillar will benefit from each other and their industry spaces will gradually converge. By contrast, if one province takes the technology-intensive industries as the pillar, their neighbour provinces can hardly do it better again. In another word, neighbour provinces will compete with each other in technology-intensive industries and their industry spaces will gradually differentiate.  These results indicate that provinces who are centralized located could have the similar industry structure with labor and capital-intensive industries instead of capital-intensive industries mainly due to the reason that neighbour provinces with capital-intensive industries will compete with each other in recruitment, etc. This work is significant to macro-industrial layout adjustment and local economic trends predication. </p>

<p>Preliminary results show that diversified provinces tend to occupy less ubiquitous industry classes whereas undiversified provinces only occupy ubiquitous industry classes. Some industrialized provinces gradually improve their economic diversity, such as Fujian, Shandong and Hainan. by contrast, the economic diversity of some less industrialized provinces is decreasing. Further, we find that GDP and regional economic diversity are positively correlated, meaning that the diversity makes more money. Besides, we show that the connection between income inequality and regional economic complexity is strong and the correlation is negatively. That is to say, the more diverse the regional economic is, the less income inequality the province has. This work help us to better understand local economic complexity and its effects on society.</p>

<p>Real networks are often embedded in space and social networks are no exception. Previous empirical studies of online social networks, email networks and mobile phone communication networks have confirmed a spatial scaling law, namely, the probability density function (PDF) of an individual to have a friend at distance \(r\) scales as \(P(r)\sim r^{\alpha}\), \(\alpha\approx-1\). In fact, prior to these empirical observations, Kleinberg has proposed a spatial network model by adding long-range links to a 2-dimensional lattice, and he has proved that when \(P(r)\sim r^{-1}\), the structure is optimal for navigation. Recently, Hu <i>et al.</i> suggested the optimization of information collection as a possible explanation for the origin of this spatial scaling law. In fact, extensive studies have shown that the spatial organization can change the dimension which dominates many important physical properties of networks.</p>
<p>Bootstrap percolation is a typical spatial network model, which was originally introduced in the context of magnetic disordered systems. Recently, bootstrap percolation has found applications in explaining many important social phenomena, such as the spreading of information, the propagation of infection, the adoption of new products and social behaviors. For instance, in emergence of cultural fads and adoption of new technology or objects, an individual can be positively influenced when there is a sufficient number of its close friends who have also done so. In other words, one may decide to buy a product when recommended by at least \(k\) users and trust a message when told by at least \(k\) neighbors; cf. the well-known rule, &lsquo;&lsquo;What I tell you three times is true&rsquo;&rsquo;. In this way, the process leads initially localized effects propagating throughout the whole network. </p>
<p>Inspired by some recent findings on spatial structure of online social networks, here we study bootstrap percolation on undirected spatial networks, with the probability density function of long-range links&rsquo; lengths being a power law with tunable exponent. Setting the size of the giant active component as the order parameter, we find a parameter-dependent critical value for the power-law exponent, above which there is a double phase transition, mixed of a second-order phase transition and a hybrid phase transition with two varying critical points, otherwise there is only a second-order phase transition. We further find a parameter-independent critical value around \(-1\), about which the two critical points for the double phase transition are almost constant. To our surprise, this critical value \(-1\) is just equal or very close to the values of many real online social networks. This work helps us in better understanding the self-organization of spatial structure of online social networks, in terms of the effective function for information spreading.</p>

<p>So far, a variety of personalized recommendation algorithms have been proposed and most of them are based on similarities, such as collaborative filtering and mass diffusion. Here, we propose a novel similarity index named CosRA, which combines advantages of both the cosine index and the resource-allocation (RA) index.</p>
<p>Taking objects \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) as an example, the cosine index between them is defined as <br /></p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
\begin{equation}
S_{\alpha\beta}^{Cos} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k_{o_\alpha} k_{o_\beta}}} \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{i\alpha} a_{i\beta},
\label{eq:cos}
\end{equation}
\]
</p><p>where \(k_{o_\alpha}\) and \(k_{o_\beta}\) are respectively the degrees of objects \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). For objects \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), the RA index is defined as <br /></p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
\begin{equation}
S_{\alpha\beta}^{RA} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{a_{i\alpha} a_{i\beta}}{k_{u_i}},
\label{eq:ra}
\end{equation}
\]
</p><p>where \(k_{u_i}\) is user \(i\)'s degree. Indeed, the RA index is the element of the transformation matrix in the MD process.</p>
<p>The CosRA index is a combination of cosine index and RA index. For objects \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), the CosRA index is defined as <br /></p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
\begin{equation}
S_{\alpha\beta}^{CosRA} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k_{o_\alpha} k_{o_\beta}}} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{a_{i\alpha} a_{i\beta}}{k_{u_i}}.
\label{eq:cosra}
\end{equation}
\]
</p><p>Based on the CosRA index, we further propose a personalized recommendation algorithm, which works as follows: Fistly, for user \(i\), the resource of object \(\alpha\) is initialized as
\(f_{\alpha}^{(i)}= a_{i\alpha}\). Secondly, the resources are redistributed via \(f&rsquo;^{(i)}= S^{CosRA} f^{(i)}\), where \(f^{(i)}\) is an \(n\)-dimensional vector recording all objects&rsquo; initial resources, given \(i\) the target user, and \(f&rsquo;^{(i)}\) is the final resource vector. At last, all objects are sorted by their resources \(f&rsquo;^{(i)}\) and the top-\(L\) uncollected objects are recommended to user \(i\). </p>
<p>To do a more systematic analysis on the CosRA index, we extend it to a more general form by introducing two turnable parameters, \(\eta_{1}\) and \(\eta_{2}\). Mathematically, the generalized CosRA index is formulated as</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
\begin{equation}
S_{\alpha\beta}^{CosRA*} = \frac{1}{(k_{o_\alpha} k_{o_\beta})^{-\eta_{2}}} \sum_{l=1}^{m} \frac{a_{l\alpha} a_{l\beta}}{(k_{u_l})^{-2 \eta_{1}}}.
\label{eq:cosra2}
\end{equation}
\]
</p><p>Notice that the original CosRA index is a special case when \(\eta_{1}=\eta_{2}=-0.5\). By varying \(\eta_{1}\) and \(\eta_{2}\), we study how the similarity index affects the performance of recommendation.</p>
<p>By applying the CosRA index to real recommender systems including MovieLens, Netflix and RYM, we show that the CosRA-based method has better performance in accuracy, diversity and novelty than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the CosRA index is free of parameters, which is a significant advantage in real applications. Further experiments show that the introduction of two turnable parameters cannot remarkably improve the overall performance of CosRA.</p>

<p>At the age of Internet, individual reputation plays the role of fundamental blocks in building up online ecosystems, especially in the filed of e-commerce. Meanwhile, new challenges arise that how to create and maintain reputation in online communities? To better uncover objects&rsquo; true quality, many platforms implement online rating systems, e.g. Amazon, eBay, Taobao, MovieLens, where users can give their feedbacks by assigning ratings to objects. Usually, high ratings result in high sales whereas low ratings play the opposite role. As a result, to extract credible information from these abundant feedbacks is becoming a major challenge since noisy ratings are widely existed in practical systems. Therefore, how to measure users&rsquo; credibility, filter out untrusted users and ensure reliability of online rating systems are becoming urgent tasks. To address this issue, so far, a variety of methods have been proposed, including network-based methods, quality-based methods and group-based ranking method. </p>
<p>However, previous more or less have some disadvantages. Network-based methods suffer from rating noises and thus have limited performance. Some of quality-based methods may not converge and some others are not robust to spamming attacks. More importantly, due to the fact that the online rating system is fundamentally a socialized information collection platform, one object should accept multiple reasonable ratings since the ratings are subjective and can be affected by users&rsquo; background and some other factors. Therefore, the underlying assumption of quality-based methods is worthy of scrutiny. Recently, we proposed a group-based ranking (GR) method, in which users are grouped based on their rating similarities, and users&rsquo; reputation is calculated by the corresponding group sizes. Users are assigned with high reputation if they always fall into large rating groups. This method is free from the assumption of the quality-based methods and it has better performance in evaluating user reputation on data sets with spamming attacks. However, the method is not robust for plenty of large-degree spammers as it's one-step process and the ratings are evenly contributed in calculating the corresponding group sizes regardless of users&rsquo; reputation.</p>
<p>As an improvement of our previous work, we further propose an iterative group-based ranking (IGR) method by introducing an iterative reputation-allocation process into the original group-based ranking (GR) method. More specifically, users with higher reputation have higher weights in dominating the corresponding group sizes. The reputation of users and the corresponding group sizes are iteratively updated until they become stable. Results on two real data sets suggest that the proposed IGR method has better performance and its robustness is considerably improved comparing with the original GR method. Our work highlights the positive role of users&rsquo; grouping behavior towards a better reputation evaluation.</p>

<p>Employees are the core and soul of enterprises, and thus human resources departments are always trying to get comprehensive understanding of employees and provide to managers valuable and effective suggestions. This issue has attracted much attention from interdisciplinary research domains. Managers and researchers are trying to dig out the major factors that lead to employees&rsquo; promotion and resignation. Most previous analyses were based on questionnaire survey, which usually consists of a small fraction of samples and contains biases caused by psychological defense.</p>
<p>Fortunately, recent IT development brings us more reliable information, such as email data, communication records, online social relations, contact networks built by wearable electronic sensors, and so on. We collect anonymous employees&rsquo; work-related interactions and social connections from a social network platform developed and used by a Chinese company consisting of more than a hundred employees, named Beijing Strong Union Technology Co. Ltd. (Strong Union for short). Accordingly, we can build two directed networks, action network (AN) and social network (SN), where nodes represent employees and links indicate the work-related interactions and social connections, respectively.</p>
<p>In this paper, through statistical analysis and prediction, we show that the structural features of both AN and SN are correlated and predictive to employees&rsquo; promotion and resignation, and the AN has higher correlation and predictability. More specifically, the in-degree in AN is the most relevant indicator for promotion; while the \(k\)-shell index in AN and in-degree in SN are both very predictive to resignation. Our results provide a novel and actionable understanding of enterprise management and suggest that to enhance the interplays among employees, no matter work-related or social interplays, can largely improve the loyalty of employees.</p>

<h2>Critical Size of Ego Communication Networks</h2>

<p>The studying of Ego Communication Networks(ECNs) is not only significant for understanding the patterns of human behaviours but also help to design better marketing strategies to promote personalized services. Previous studies mainly focus on either the overall properties of the global networks or just one single perspective (e.g., the link weight) of communication networks, while ignore other structural properties, such as the balance of in-degree and out-degree. </p>
<p>In this ongoing project, we investigate the Call Detail Records(CDRs) from ego perspective. The data covers 32 million records of 6 million people in China in a period of January to June in 2014. The basic information of the data contains the anonymised caller and callee IDs, the time stamp, the duration, etc. We define three indices to quantify the structural properties of the directed ego communication networks, namely, the average link weights, the level of structural balance and the the ratio of out contacts. </p>
<p>Preliminary results show that ECNs have a critical size of 150, above which the network properties will change dramatically. Further experiments show that the limits of ego network size are the same for online social networks and mobile communication networks which can be validated by both link weights and huge ego network structural changes. Our work shed lights on more structure properties of ego networks beyond Dunbar's Number.</p>

<p>Women are underrepresented in many areas of STEM and most high-level positions in organizations. Empirical results showed evidence of gender bias in job hunting, personal research funding application evaluations. We are particularly interested in understanding the gender bias in academic or organizations, and figuring out the way to help women. Our approach is to explore the co-authorship network after identifying the  of authors, especially focus on the output, publish year, and cooperation of women scientists. </p>
