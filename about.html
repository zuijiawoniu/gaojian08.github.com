<h2>Brief Bio</h2>
<p>Jian Gao is currently a Ph.D. Student in <a href="http://www.labcomplex.org" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>CompleX Lab, Web Sciences Center</a>, <a href="http://en.uestc.edu.cn" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)</a>. His research interests focus on understanding phenomena in social and economic systems through empirical and theoretical analysis. He is working with <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MXgWgmEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Tao Zhou</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1QTe3cQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Dr Yanqing Hu</a> (<a href="http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Sun Yat-sen University</a>) in solving a variety of problems, including personalized recommendation in web-based systems, reputation evaluation in online rating systems, information spreading in spatial social networks, local industry structure modeling in China, etc. His works have been published in some peer-reviewed scientific journals, such as <a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Nature Scientific Reports</a>, <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0295-5075" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Europhysics Letters</a>, <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/physica-a-statistical-mechanics-and-its-applications/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Physica A</a> and <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0256-307X/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Chinese Physics Letters</a>.</p>
<p>Jian Gao received his B.Sc Degree in Information and Computing Science from <a href="http://en.uestc.edu.cn" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>UESTC</a> in 2012. As undergraduate, he won the <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2012/results/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Outstanding Winner</a> of the <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/icm/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM)</a> in 2012. He was awarded as the Outstanding Student of UESTC (the highest honour for undergraduate) in 2011. After graduation, Jian Gao was registered a Master Student  in <a href="http://www.ccse.uestc.edu.cn/english/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>School of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="http://en.uestc.edu.cn" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>UESTC</a>, majoring in Computational Intelligence. During that period, he worked with <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MXgWgmEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Tao Zhou</a>, studying online ranking method and promotion/resignation predication in employee networks. In parallel, he served as a research assistant to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1cKbdYEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Mingsheng Shang</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nGDBb0kAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Dr. Shimin Cai</a>, studying recommender systems and missing value imputation. From 2012 to 2014, he also served as a Student Instructor in the Association of Mathematical Modeling of UESTC. During graduate school, he has found summer intern in two start-up companies, <a href="http://www.shulianxunying.com/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Hire Big Data, LTD.</a> as an Algorithm Engineer in 2014 and <a href="http://www.bbdservice.com/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Business Big Data, LTD.</a> as a Data Analyst in 2015.</p>
<p>Jian Gao was born on May 28, 1989, and grew up in suburb of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Harbin, Heilongjiang</a>, in a small village living on agriculture. His memories of childhood was full filled of doing hands-on farming (no machine at that time) with his parents and three sisters. Then he attended the primary school in the village and finished the middle school in the town. After four years hard work, he was admitted by the county-level best high school, <a href="http://www.hljszzx.com" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Shangzhi No. 1 High School</a>. During the high school, he was especially good at physics and won the first prize in Provincial Physics Contest. After graduation in 2008, he was admitted by UESTC, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Chengdu, Sichuan</a>. He has regarded Chengdu as his second hometown after over seven years living. From village to town, from country to 3000km away city, he would go farther on the ways of travelling and seeking knowledge.</p>
